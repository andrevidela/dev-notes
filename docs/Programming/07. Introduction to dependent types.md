# 07 Introduction to dependent types

This is a written summary of a presentation for BCS on the 29th of March 2022.

Main thread: dependent type for pratical purposes / industry

Goal of dependent types:

- Avoid mistakes
- Constrain programs
- Prove things

Benefits:

- Informative types
- Informative errors
- Interactive editing

## Avoiding mistakes

Find the bug in this program

```Java
first of list

```

In Idris this would be a type error

```idris
```

## Constrain programs

Here we can call this API with an empty string

```
DateFormat format = new SimpleDataFormat("")
```

But in idris this would be a type error

```
main = let myFormat = Main.fromString "yyyy/MM/dd"
        in printLn myFormat

```

Error:

```
While processing right hand side of main. Can't find an implementation for StringFormat "".
```


## Prove things


find an API where you just did something but you still have to check for it

## Additional benefits

- Informative types
- Informative errors
- Interactive editing

## Informative types

Server API in the type
CLI options in the type

## Informative errors

Show example of unhelpful errors

Show exmaple of helpful error

## Interactive editing

Show type-at
Show jump to definition
Show skeleton definition
Show expression search
Show module browsing

## My research: Servers and dependent types

write the type and the the server
write the server and then infer the type
write the description and generate the server
