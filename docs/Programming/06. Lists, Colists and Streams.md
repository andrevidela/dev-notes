# Differences between `List` `Colist` and `Stream`

- A `List` is a finite datastructure containing multiple elements, possibly 0. 
- a `Stream` is an infinite datastructure, it always produces elements when queried. This
also means it contains at least one element.
- A `CoList` is a possibly infinite list of elements, possibly 0.

## Definitions

```
data List a = Nil | (::) a (List a)

record stream (a : Type) where
  constructor (::)
  head : a
  tail : Inf (Stream a)

data CoList a = Nil | (::) a (Inf (Stream a))
```

So a `List` is a finite `Colist` and a `Stream` is an infinite `CoList`

Maybe `CoList` and `Stream` should be flipped so both `List` and `CoList` are derivable
from `Stream`?
