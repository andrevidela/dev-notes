# Getting started with Idris

Idris is an experimental programming language with a lot of fancy features, most importantly _dependent types_ and _quantities_. In this document I will provide basic information about how to use Idris and show what's neat about it

## A note about installation

This will not cover how to install idris. For this refer to the [installation instructions](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/blob/main/INSTALL.md). There is a video tutorial about how to do it for [windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAGTLlwKM48).

Installing Idris can sometimes not work for a lot of various reasons, every computer is different and the team isn't big enough to catch all possible edge cases. So if you have a problem with installation, head to the idris [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UX68fDs2jc).

# Types and functions

Idris being a _functional_ programming language it deals with two basic concepts: _Types_ and _functions_.

Type tell what the program is supposed to do, functions implement what the types say:

```
sayHello : (personName : String) -> String
sayHello personName = "hello \{personName}!"
```

This is an example of a function, it takes a piece of text, which is described by the type `String` and returns a new piece of text. This is described by the type `(name : String) -> String`. Notice on the left of the arrow, the type has `personName` written in front of it. This is to give a name to the argument of the function. The function itself has a name `sayHello`. The first line `sayHello : (personName : String) -> String` declares the _type_ of the function and the second line `sayHello personName = "hello \{personName}!"` declares the _implementation_ of the function.

# Running programs

The example above is fairly basic but actually _does_ something, provided we can run it. For this we are going to need to do the following:

- Create a file called "Main.idr"
- Write a `main` function
- Compile and run our program using the Idris compiler
